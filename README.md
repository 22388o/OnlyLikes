# OnlyLikes

OnlyLikes is a Nostr web client written in Blazor Webassembly that puts an emphasis on user sovereignty, stability, and simplicity, without sacrificing the quality of life that users expect. 

We implement NIPs that are stable and well defined, and that do not threaten the safety of users or relay operators. We also plan (in time) to allow nearly every feature to be enabled or disabled by our users on a one-on-one basis.

Absolutely *no* data is stored by us about you. The app runs entirely in your browser, and connects to relays. Your IP address may be logged when you access a host of this software, for security purposes. We suggest you run a VPN while using OnlyLikes.

Because we store no metrics, we rely on our users submitting bug reports, or letting us know when something does not work the way they would expect. This is the tradeoff involved in respecting our user’s privacy - we rely on you to provide the feedback.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. You must follow best practices to the extent of your ability, and we expect code submissions to follow the naming conventions recommended by the Roslyn compiler/Visual Studio.

We develop on every platform, so regardless of what you’re running, your tests and contributions are both possible and wanted. This repo was initialized from a Chromebook. :)
